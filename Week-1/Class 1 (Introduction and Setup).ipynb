    "  \n",
    "Throughout this course we are going to learn python from zero to the advance level in a very fun and interactive way.    \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be doing a bunch of class activities, coding exercises, projects and HomeWorks (lol ! I know this one is boring üòÜ).   \n",
    "But, the only thing I need from you is the willingness of learning and asking questions again and again. \n",

    "Programming is giving a set of instructions to a computer to execute. If you‚Äôve ever cooked using a recipe before, you can think of yourself as the computer and the recipe‚Äôs author as a programmer. The recipe author provides you with a set of instructions which you read and then follow. The more complex the instructions, the more complex the result!   - Codecademy.  \n",

    "The low-level language is a programming language that provides no abstraction from the hardware, and it is represented in 0 or 1 forms, which are the machine instructions. The languages that come under this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The high-level language is a programming language that allows a programmer to write the programs which are independent of a particular type of computer. The high-level languages are considered as high-level because they are closer to human languages than machine-level languages. Guess the examples of high level languages?  \n",

    "## Difference between Interpreter and compiler\n",
    "An interpreted language is one in which instructions are exectued sequentially. Python is just one example of an interpreted language. The Python interpreter reads your code line-by-line, executing instructions as it reads. If the interpreter finds an error, your program will crash immediately upon the execution of the offending instruction.\n",

    "To see the Python interpreter in action, visit this repl  and run the code example therein. https://repl.it/languages/python3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilers\n",
    "The topic of compilers is vast, complex, and far outside the scope of this lesson. What you should know right now is that compiled languages are \"translated\" into a target language (like assembly or machine code) before running. If any errors exist in your program, the compiler will fail and your code won't be able to run until all of the errors are fixed. The general workflow when writing in a language that needs to be compiled looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write/edit code\n",
    "2. Compile code\n",
    "3. Run the compiled executable\n",
    "As you can imagine, these multiple steps make it a bit more time-consuming to diagnose errors. However, compiled languages tend to be faster as they are usually better tuned for the specific hardware environment in which they run.  \n",

    "## How does actually python works?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language like Java. Python is called an interpreted language. Python uses code modules that are interchangeable instead of a single long list of instructions that was standard for functional programming languages. The standard implementation of python is called ‚Äúcpython‚Äù. It is the default and widely used implementation of the Python.\n",
    "Python doesn‚Äôt convert its code into machine code, something that hardware can understand. It actually converts it into something called byte code. So within python, compilation happens, but it‚Äôs just not into a machine language. It is into byte code and this byte code can‚Äôt be understood by CPU. So we need actually an interpreter called the python virtual machine. The python virtual machine executes the byte codes.    \n",
    "  \n",

    "  \n",
    "The Python interpreter performs following tasks to execute a Python program :\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1 : The interpreter reads a python code or instruction. Then it verifies that the instruction is well formatted, i.e. it checks the syntax of each line.If it encounters any error, it immediately halts the translation and shows an error message.\n",
    "* Step 2 : If there is no error, i.e. if the python instruction or code is well formatted then the interpreter translates it into its equivalent form in intermediate language called ‚ÄúByte code‚Äù.Thus, after successful execution of Python script or code, it is completely translated into Byte code.\n",
    "* Step 3 : Byte code is sent to the Python Virtual Machine(PVM).Here again the byte code is executed on PVM.If an error occurs during this execution then the execution is halted with an error message.\n",
